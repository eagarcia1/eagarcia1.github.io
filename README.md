# ABOUT ME
## MY INTERESTS
> Petting my kitties. They are 2 black cats named Ricky and Pete. My family did not name them. We got them from the animal shelter. So they already had names when we got them.

> Playing video games. My favorite games are grand theft auto and Battlefield. People automatically think of Grand Theft Auto 5 when they think of the GTA series. But the best one was GTA 4. I believe this because the story was more grounded in reality.

> Passing every class with an A. It will take a lot of hard work and cooperation, but I know that I can do it. If we want to pass this class then we will need to work together to get it done.

> Telling my family who does not live in North Carolina that Wake Tech is a University instead of a community college.

## WEBSITES I RECOMMEND
1. [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) - I like this website because I am going to need to learn mermaid if I want to pass this class. This tool will be useful to learn mermaid processes.
2. [Medal of Honor](https://www.cmohs.org/) - The story of the recipients of the Medal of Honor inspire me to be the best that I can be. The Medal of Honor is the highest award for the arms service, and is awarded by the President.
3. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I can use this website to find tutorials about Mermaid so that I can pass. There is a lot of knowledge that I can obtain from the tutorials on this website.

```python# Simple Python program to greet the user and calculate when they'll turn 100

# Ask for user's name and age
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# Calculate the year when the user will turn 100
current_year = 2025
year_turn_100 = current_year - age + 100

# Print a greeting message and when the user will turn 100
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
print(f"You will turn 100 years old in the year {year_turn_100}.")
