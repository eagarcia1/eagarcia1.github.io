```python# Simple Python program to greet the user and calculate when they'll turn 100

# Ask for user's name and age
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# Calculate the year when the user will turn 100
current_year = 2025
year_turn_100 = current_year - age + 100

# Print a greeting message and when the user will turn 100
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
print(f"You will turn 100 years old in the year {year_turn_100}.")
```
