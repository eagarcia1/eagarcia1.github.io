    <h1>My Introduction</h1>
    <h2>My name is Esteban Garcia</h2>
    <p>I am an Information Technology student and every day I am at Wake Tech, I want to find new ways to be the best student I can be, and help other students to be the best that they can be.</p>
    <p>One strategy that I use to achieve this is to record all of the lessons and then review the video later for reference. This is great because there are a lot of steps, and I would likely be lost in doing this assignment if not for my videos.</p>
    <p>A way that I help my fellow classmates is to ask questions if there was something that I did not understand. This will help my class because they might have the same question but are afraid to ask.</p>
